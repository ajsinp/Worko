                Step 4: Follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your Slack workspace and authorize Worko's access. <br />

                Step 5: Once authorized, you will receive an API token that you can use to connect Worko and Slack. <br />

                Step 6: Once you've entered the necessary information, click "Save" or "Connect" to establish the integration.
