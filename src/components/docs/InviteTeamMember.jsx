            <h2 style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>Integrating with a Third-Party Platform</h2>

            <p style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>To set up an integration with an external service, you'll typically need to generate API tokens or access keys. Below is an <br /> example of how to set up a Slack integration with Worko:</p>

            <p style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>Step 1: Log in to your Worko account. <br />

                Step 2: Navigate to the "Integrations" or "Settings" section, and choose "Slack Integration." <br />

                Step 3: Click on the "Connect to Slack" button to start the integration process. <br />

                Step 4: Follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your Slack workspace and authorize Worko's access. <br />

                Step 5: Once authorized, you will receive an API token that you can use to connect Worko and Slack. <br />

                Step 6: Once you've entered the necessary information, click "Save" or "Connect" to establish the integration.
            </p>

            <p style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>By following these steps, you can easily set up and manage integrations with external services to enhance your task <br /> management capabilities in Worko.</p>
            <h2 style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>Team Member Onboarding</h2>
            <p style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>When team members receive the invitation, they will typically receive an email with a link to join your Worko organization. <br /> Here's what they need to do:</p>

            <p style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>Step 1: Check their email for the invitation from Worko. <br />

                Step 2: Click on the invitation link to join the organization. <br />

            <h2 style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>Using the Code Block</h2>
            <p style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>To programmatically invite team members using the Worko API, you can use the following code example:</p>

            <p style={{ padding: "revert", margin: "revert", fontSize: "revert",}}>This code sends an invitation to the specified email address and assigns the "user" role to the new team member.
